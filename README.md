### Description:
This project is themed on Census data. The Census data was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The underlying idea behind the project is to predict income off of various provided Census data, such as age, type of employer, years spent in education, etc. We created 4 different approaches to solve this problem (Version 1, Version 2, Version 3, and Version 4). For each approach we performed Exploratory Data Analysis to figure out the trends and ideas behind our dataset, did feature engineering to optimize features for our models, ran our models, and then tested their performance. The purpose of this project is to figure out the best practices to solving this income prediction problem and come up with a final prediction that optimizes by combining the predictions across the four different approaches.
